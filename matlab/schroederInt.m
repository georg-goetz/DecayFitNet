function decay = schroederInt(rir, upperLim)
% calculates Schroeder decay from a room impulse response by doing
% backwards integration
% 
% Inputs:
%   rir          - room impulse response [lenRir, 1]
%   upperLim     - upper limit of integration, should be chosen such that
%                noise floor is not included in integration
%
% Outputs:
%   decay   - Schroeder decay, linear scale [lenRir, 1]

% irIntegrated = (1/length(rir)) * cumtrapz(irSquared); % integrate with trapezoids
% decay = flipud(irIntegrated(2:end)); % flip again, so that decay is right way around, and get rid of 0 value (would throw error when calculating log)
% decay = [decay; decay(end)]; % repeat last value so decay has same length as rir
